## Overview

This project implements a novel framework for multi-robot path planning using spacetime grids. The solution enables multiple robots to compute efficient, collision-free trajectories in real-time while relying on localization sensors and inter-robot wireless communication. The implementation uses the A* search algorithm combined with 3D space-time path planning to resolve path conflicts dynamically.

## Key Features

- Decentralized path planning system
- Real-time trajectory computation and conflict resolution
- Efficient A* search implementation
- 3D spacetime path planning
- Inter-robot collision avoidance
- Edge clash detection and resolution
- Scalable to multiple robots with O(n) replanning time complexity
- Deadlock situation handling

## Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- Robots with SLAM sensors
- Microcontroller with sufficient memory to store multiple robot paths
- Wireless communication capability (Bluetooth/Zigbee)

### Software Dependencies
- CoppeliaSim simulation environment
- Python with OOP support

## Implementation Details

### State Space
- Coordinates: (x, y, t) where x,y are cartesian coordinates and t is timestep
- Action Space: stay, up, down, left, right
- Cost Function: Uniform cost of 1 for all actions

### Key Components

1. **Motion Planner Module**
   - Robot class with attributes and functions
   - Search algorithms (A*, BFS, UCS, DFS)
   - Map handling

2. **Robot Controller Module**
   - PID controller parameters
   - Differential drive robot control

### Algorithm Features

- Spacetime path planning
- Dynamic replanning when robots are within threshold distance
- Edge clash detection and resolution
- Priority-based collaborative planning
- Deadlock resolution

## Performance Analysis

The efficiency of the algorithm has been analyzed based on several parameters:

1. **Stay Action Cost**
   - Initial rise in expanded nodes
   - Stabilizes at higher costs

2. **Replanning Threshold Distance**
   - Higher threshold leads to more frequent replanning
   - Linear increase in expanded nodes with threshold distance

3. **Heuristic Comparison**
   - Manhattan distance heuristic performs better than Euclidean
   - More efficient node expansion for 4-way moving robots

## Limitations

- Sequential replanning based on robot order
- Idle waiting time for lower priority robots during replanning
- Planning stops at goal achievement, potentially missing optimal paths for other robots
- Increased time complexity due to additional 'stay' action

## Future Work

- Implementation of parallel replanning
- Integration of kinodynamic constraints
- Optimization of time parameterization
- Enhancement of cost function to include both space and time weights
